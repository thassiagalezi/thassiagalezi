## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a multilingual professional with a diverse background in international trade, wellness, and hospitality. I’m currently transitioning into the field of **Cybersecurity and Programming**, driven by curiosity, adaptability, and a passion for continuous learning.

After years of international experience in customer-facing roles, business operations, and wellness coaching, I decided to bring my focus to the digital world — starting with Python, Linux, and cybersecurity fundamentals.
